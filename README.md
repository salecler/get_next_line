# get_next_line ‚úçÔ∏è

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static
variables.
## üõ† Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/salecler/get_next_line.git
```
    
## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

To deploy this project run:

```bash
  make
```
Then you can run it:
````
./gnl
````
## üë®‚Äçüè´ Instructions

‚Ä¢ Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let
you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.

‚Ä¢ Your function should return the line that was read.
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.

‚Ä¢ Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when
reading from the standard input.

‚Ä¢ Please note that the returned line should include the terminating \n character,
except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.

‚Ä¢ Your header file get_next_line.h must at least contain the prototype of the
get_next_line() function.

‚Ä¢ Add all the helper functions you need in the get_next_line_utils.c file

‚Ä¢ Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to your
compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n
It will define the buffer size for read().
The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette
in order to test your code.

‚Ä¢ You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example):
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c

‚Ä¢ We consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to
by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas read() didn‚Äôt reach the
end of file.

‚Ä¢ We also consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior when reading
a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if
you want to.
